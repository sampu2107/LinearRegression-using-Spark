# LinearRegression-using-Spark

Multiple linear regression implemented using pyspark. Implemented a standalone Python/Spark program to perform multiple linear regression using the closed form expression for the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate.It performs the multiple linear regression by computing the summation form of the closed form expression for the ordinary least squares estimate of beta. It takes the yx file as input, where on each line y is the first element and the remaining elements constitute the x. Finally, Beta coefficients are written to the output file.
